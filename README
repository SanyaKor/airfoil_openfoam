unit_tests.sh - bash script that allows you to run multiple tests for angles from 1 to N (N le 30, default value 30). For your N value just enter the first argument to the script, e.g. script.sh 10 

unit_testing.ipynb - Jupyter file  which consists to cells, first one is to calculate angles for angles.txt file, second one is to analyse data from forceCoeffs(Cl, Cd)

data.txt - file with drag & lift for testing different angles of attack

AIRFOIL_TESTS - folder with tests, eg TESTSN_date with all forceCoeffs .dat files inside and with angles which necessary for calculation. For instance, after running unit_tests.sh 10 u will get TESTSN_date with 10 .dat files for each simulation + 1 angles file.

cleaner.sh - bash script that works nearly like an ./Allclean

RUNNING pipeline : (if u delete data.txt file) unit_testing.ipynb (first cell) -> unit_tests.sh -> unit_testing.ipynb (second cell)

Folder blockMeshGen - files blockMeshGen.ipynb Jupyter script allows to create my own blockMesh file, and it also works quite good with this solver. But I got some odd values for CL function like 10^75 from some tests, that's why I leaving my block mesh here and using the other blockMesh with +- good params.
